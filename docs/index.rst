Monitoring Service
------------------

The Monitoring Service watches open payment channels when the user is not
online. In case one of the userâ€™s channel partners wants to close a channel
while the user is offline, the monitoring service sends the latest balance
proof to the smart contract and thus ensures the correct settlement of the
channel.

Pathfinding Service
-------------------

The Pathfinding service supports users in finding the cheapest or shortest way
to route a payment through the network. A pathfinding service relies on data
from the network, the respective smart contract as well as information provided
voluntarily by mediating nodes. This information consists of the mediation fees
charged and the respective available channel capacities.

Installation
------------

The Raiden services are available through the pip package
``raiden-services``. As there is currently a lot of development activity, we
recommend to use the latest version from git right now.

The Raiden services require Python 3.7. To install the latest version of
the services follow these instructions:

.. code:: bash

    git clone git@github.com:raiden-network/raiden-services.git
    cd raiden-services
    virtualenv -p python3.7 venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -U -r requirements-dev.txt
    pip install -e .

This installs the executables ``pathfinding-service``, ``monitoring-service``
and ``request-collector`` into the virtual environment.

Running the services
--------------------

The services share a number of options. These are:

``--keystore-file``
    Defines the path to the keystore file. (*Required*)

``--log-level``
    Defines the minimal level of log messages to be shown.

    Defaults to ``INFO``.

``--log-json/--no-log-json``
    Enables or disables the logging to be JSON formatted.

    Defaults to ``False``.

``--eth-rpc``
    Defines the URI of the Ethereum node to be used.

    Defaults to ``http://localhost:8545``.

``--token-network-registry-contract-address``
    Defines the address of the token network registry to be used.

    Defaults to the contract address that the Raiden client uses for the given
    chain.

``--user-deposit-contract-address``
    Defines the address of the user deposit contract to be used.

    Defaults to the contract address that Raiden the client uses for the given
    chain.

``--start-block``
    Defines the block number at which the service starts syncing.

    Defaults to the block number in which the earliest contract was deployed,
    but only if predeployed contracts are used. Otherwise it is set to 0.

``--confirmations``
    Defines the number of blocks after which blocks are assumed confirmed.

    Defaults to 8 blocks.

Pathfinding Service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Pathfinding service has some additional parameters which can be set.

``--state-db``
    Defines the location where the state is stored.

    Defaults to ``~/.config/raiden-pathfinding-service/state.db`` on Unix or
    ``~/Library/Application Support/raiden-pathfinding-service/state.db`` on
    macOS.

``--host``
    Defines the URI the REST API of the Pathfinding service will be available
    at.

    Defaults to ``localhost``.

``--service-fee``
    Defines the minimum service fee a client has to pay when requesting routes.

    Defaults to zero.


``--enable-debug``
    Enabled the extended REST API for debugging. We strongly advise against
    enabling this option on nodes that are reachable on the network.

    Disabled by default.


Monitoring Service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Monitoring service consists of two components that have to be started
independently for now. The ``monitoring-service`` program is responsible for
all interactions with the blockchain and **must** be started first, as it
writes some essential information to the state database.
Afterwards the ``request-collector`` can be started. It listens to the public
Matrix room for monitoring request from Raiden nodes and validates and saves
them to the monitoring services database.

.. note::
    The reason for this separation is security. Even when request collector
    are attacked, the monitoring service continues to work and can safely
    monitor the user's channels.

The Monitoring service has some additional parameters which can be set.

``--state-db``
    Defines the location where the state is stored.

    Defaults to ``~/.config/raiden-monitoring-service/state.db`` on Unix or
    ``~/Library/Application Support/raiden-monitoring-service/state.db`` on
    macOS.

``--monitor-contract-address``
    Defines the address of the monitoring contract to be used.

    Defaults to the contract address that the Raiden client uses for the given
    chain.

``--min-reward``
    Defines the minimum reward a client has to pay when sending a request for
    monitoring.

    Defaults to zero.


The request collector shares the database path with the monitoring service

``--state-db``
    Defines the location where the state is of the monitoring service is
    stored.

    Defaults to ``~/.config/raiden-monitoring-service/state.db`` on Unix or
    ``~/Library/Application Support/raiden-monitoring-service/state.db`` on
    macOS.


Claim Pathfinding Fees
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are running the Pathfinding Service with ``--service-fee``, the service
fees will need to be claimed to actually reach your wallet. Claiming fees less
frequently will reduce the Ethereum transactions costs spent while claiming,
while not claiming for a long time might make you miss the expiration block for
your claims. The ``claim-pfs-fees`` script helps doing this in a profitable and
reasonably easy way. You must use the same ``keystore`` and ``state-db`` as for
running the Pathfinding Service.

In addition to the mandatory parameters, the following parameters are useful to increase profitability:

``--rdn-per-eth``
    The RDN/ETH price used to calculate whether the value of a fee IOU exceeds
    the transactions costs to claim it.

``--expires-within``
    Only IOUs which expire within this number of blocks will be claimed.
    Reducing this number gives the IOUs more time to accumulate a higher
    amount, allowing higher amounts to be claimed with the same Ethereum
    transaction costs. Increasing this value makes it less likely for IOUs to
    expire before being claimed, if you run ``claim-pfs-fees`` rarely or at
    irregular intervals.
